# Travel Planner

A visualizer and generator for trip planning. 

## Goal 

The goal of this project is to have a travel agent powered by GPTs. Instead of just laying out a trip, it interacts with Delta, TripAdvisor, and Bookings.com to find rooms, flights, and things to do. 

From there, it creates an interactive map friendly view of the trip. Using Leaflet JS as a way to map it, interacting with Apple Maps so they can be used on your phone.
